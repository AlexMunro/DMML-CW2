/**
8. Build two or three Bayes networks of more complex architecture for (a smaller version of)
this data set, increasing the number of connections among the nodes. Construct one of them
semi-manually (e.g use K2 algorithm and vary the maximum number of parents), and two
others – using Weka’s algorithms for learning Bayes net construction (e.g. use TAN or Hill
Climbing algorithms).
8.1 Run the experiments described in items (4-6) on these new Bayes network architectures.
Record, compare and analyse the outputs, in the light of the previously conclusions
about the given data. What kind of dependencies in the data did you discover? Does it
help, and how, to use Bayes nets that are more sophisticated than Naïve Bayes nets?
(You may want to read Chapter 6.7, pages 266-270 and pages 451-454 of the Data
Mining textbook by Witten et al. before you do these exercises or
